<h1>Our Product: EcoTrack</h1>

<h2>What Is EcoTrack?</h2>
<p>
EcoTrack is a school based climate action app designed to raise awareness and encourage students to reduce their environmental impact. The app allows students to track positive actions they take for the environment and see their progress over time.
</p>

<h2>How EcoTrack Works</h2>
<p>
Students can record actions such as:
<br>– Walking or cycling to school instead of taking a car  
<br>– Recycling materials instead of throwing them away  
<br>– Saving electricity by turning off lights and devices  
<br>– Using reusable bottles and containers instead of single use plastics  
<br>– Participating in school clean up events
</p>

<p>
Each positive action earns points. Classes and groups can compete in friendly competitions to see who can make the greatest positive environmental impact. This makes climate action fun, measurable, and rewarding.
</p>

<h2>Why EcoTrack Helps</h2>
<p>
EcoTrack encourages behavioural change by making climate action visible. When students see their progress, they are more likely to continue positive habits. The competitive element motivates students to stay engaged and make daily decisions that benefit the environment.
</p>

<h2>Expected Impact</h2>
<p>
By increasing awareness and encouraging consistent positive behaviour, EcoTrack could help reduce waste and energy use within the school community. Over time, schools using EcoTrack could become models for sustainability, inspiring other schools to take similar climate action.
