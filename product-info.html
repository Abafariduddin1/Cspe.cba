      <h1>EcoTrack Smart Monitor</h1>
      <p>
        EcoTrack is a proposed smart home device designed to help households
        reduce their carbon footprint. The purpose of this product is to
        increase awareness of energy consumption and encourage responsible
        environmental behaviour.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Many people are unaware of how much electricity and energy they
        consume daily. This lack of awareness leads to unnecessary waste,
        higher emissions, and increased climate damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without real-time feedback, individuals often continue habits that
        contribute to environmental degradation.

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        EcoTrack connects to household energy systems and displays live
        electricity usage through a clear digital dashboard. It highlights
        when energy consumption spikes and provides suggestions for reducing waste.

      <h2>Impact on Climate Action</h2>
      <p>
        If widely adopted, EcoTrack could significantly reduce unnecessary
        energy consumption. When households become aware of their usage
        patterns, they are more likely to make responsible decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Climate action requires both policy change and individual
        responsibility. This product encourages citizens to actively
        participate in reducing environmental harm.
