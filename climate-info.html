      <h1>Climate Action</h1>
      <p>
        Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is happening now. 
        Rising global temperatures, stronger storms, droughts, and flooding are 
        increasing every year. Climate action means taking responsibility to reduce 
        the damage caused by human activity and protect the planet for future generations.

      <h2>The Rising Dangers</h2>
      <p>
        Scientific research shows that global temperatures have increased significantly
        due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. This increase is
        causing serious environmental consequences worldwide.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rising sea levels threatening coastal communities</li>
        <li>More intense storms and flooding events</li>
        <li>Longer heatwaves affecting public health</li>
        <li>Wildfires becoming more frequent and destructive</li>
        <li>Loss of biodiversity and endangered species</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Awareness Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Awareness is the first step toward meaningful change. When people understand
        the seriousness of climate change, they are more likely to support policies,
        reduce waste, conserve energy, and make sustainable choices in their daily lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education encourages responsibility. Young people especially have the power
        to influence future environmental decisions through innovation and activism.

      <h2>Actions We Can Take</h2>
      <p>
        Climate action involves both individual and collective efforts. Governments,
        businesses, schools, and individuals all play important roles.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switching to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power</li>
        <li>Reducing plastic consumption and improving recycling systems</li>
        <li>Using public transport or cycling to reduce carbon emissions</li>
        <li>Supporting sustainable companies and local agriculture</li>
        <li>Planting trees and protecting natural habitats</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Small changes, when multiplied across millions of people, create significant impact.
