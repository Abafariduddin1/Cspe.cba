<h1>Sustainability</h1>

<h2>What Is Sustainability?</h2>
<p>
Sustainability means meeting the needs of people today without destroying the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It focuses on protecting natural resources such as water, forests, soil, clean air, and biodiversity so they are not permanently damaged or exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Sustainability is built on three key pillars: environmental protection, social responsibility, and economic stability. True sustainability requires balance between all three.
</p>

<h2>The Increasing Environmental Dangers</h2>
<p>
The world is currently facing serious environmental threats that are growing more severe each year. Natural resources are being consumed faster than they can be replaced. Forests are being cleared at high rates for agriculture and development, oceans are filling with plastic waste, and air pollution is damaging human health. Many animal and plant species are becoming endangered due to habitat destruction.
</p>

<p>
If these problems continue without action, future generations may face shortages of clean water, food insecurity, and unsafe living conditions. This makes sustainability not just a goal but a necessity.
</p>

<h2>Why Awareness Matters</h2>
<p>
Many environmental problems continue because people are unaware of how serious they are. Raising awareness helps individuals understand that small daily actions have long term global consequences.
</p>

<p>
When people are informed, they are more likely to:
<br>– Reduce waste and recycle properly  
<br>– Save electricity and water  
<br>– Avoid single use plastics  
<br>– Support sustainable businesses  
<br>– Think carefully about consumption
</p>

<h2>How Individuals Can Help</h2>
<p>
Every person has a role to play. Individuals can:
<br>– Turn off lights when not in use  
<br>– Walk or cycle short distances instead of driving  
<br>– Reduce food waste by planning meals carefully  
<br>– Reuse materials instead of throwing them away  
<br>– Participate in environmental activities in their school or community
